            <h2 class="">The Struggle</h2>
            <p>
              After closing my startup, Reliby, because we failed to find a suitable business model, I embarked on a new endeavor: <strong>looking for a job.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              It proved to be awful.
            </p>
            <p>
              I faced hundreds of applications and almost zero interviews. The conversion rate was abysmal. I reached a point where I started thinking it would be faster to print my resume and go door-to-door handing out copies.
            </p>
            <p>
               It was weird. I knew I was a good fit for most of the jobs I applied to. My work history was unconventional as a founder, but I had learned a lot and was sure I could bring immense value. Yet, I wasn't even getting calls.
            </p>
            <p>
               I started to think the problem was me—my experience, or my broad skill set. So, I created <strong>5 different resumes</strong>, focusing on different positions for all the roles I covered at Reliby: Product Manager, CTO, Senior Software Engineer, Data Engineer, UX Designer.
            </p>
            <p>
               I applied <strong>8 hours a day for months</strong>. The result? Still abysmal. The few calls I got were passionate about my experience, but they were too few to call the search off.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      
       <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
            <h3 class="">Fighting the Wrong Enemy (The Bot)</h3>
            <p>
               Frustrated by wasting time answering "stupid questions" on LinkedIn for a <1% conversion rate, I used my product engineer mindset to brute-force the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              I built a <strong>Bot to mass-apply to jobs</strong> using LLMs (ChatGPT technology). It answered questions from a knowledge base about me automatically.
            </p>
            <p>
              This got me a lot of interviews without wasting my days. It even gained traction on GitHub and was featured in a newspaper. But the conversion rate was still low. I was getting interviews, but often for roles where I was a "broken clock" match—right by accident. I was still missing the opportunities where I fit perfectly.
            </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

          <div class="">
            <h2 class="">The Insight</h2>
            <p>
              I stopped applying and started <strong>learning</strong>. I looked at the hiring process from the other side. I went down a deep rabbit hole investigating the tools HR uses to screen resumes.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I learned was shocking: <strong>ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) were destroying my chances.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              These systems are incredibly "dumb." They often can't read complex PDFs, ignore tables and images, and fail to understand context. If you use a different job title than they expect, they don't see you as a match.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wasn't getting rejected because I wasn't good enough. I was getting rejected because the software couldn't read my resume.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I tested a radical solution. I created a resume in the <strong>ugliest way possible</strong> using a plain text editor. It wasn't designed for humans; it was designed for machines. I made sure every common word from the job description was there.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The result changed everything.</strong> My interview ratio skyrocketed. I was getting calls from companies I had never heard of, and finally getting traction on the roles I actually wanted.
            </p>

          <div class="">
            <h2 class="">The Evolution</h2>
            <p>
              The success of my "ugly resume" approach didn't just land me a job I love; it turned me into the de facto career coach for my friends and family.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started manually optimizing resumes for them, applying the same rigorous standards I had developed for myself. <strong>And it worked for them too.</strong> But manual optimization is exhausting. I needed to scale myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              I began building tools. First, a simple script to verify if a PDF would survive the "dumbest" ATS filters. Then, templates that walked the fine line between looking good to humans and being readable by robots. Finally, I started integrating LLMs to help with the heavy lifting of rewriting and customization.
            </p>
            <p>
               As word got out, friends of friends started asking for access. The passion project grew into a platform.
            </p>
            <p>
               <strong>The Resume Monster</strong> is the culmination of that journey. It is not just a tool; it is a system designed to reverse-engineer the hiring process.

               <p>
                 Mass applying is like a broken clock—right twice a day by accident. We aim for precision. If you fit the job, your resume should prove it beyond a doubt.

               <p>
                 It is not about lying or keyword stuffing. It is about translation. We translate your varied experiences into the specific dialect of the employer.

            <p>
              The core insight driving The Resume Monster is that <strong>context matters</strong>. A generic resume is a "jack of all trades, master of none" document. To pass the screen, you need to be the <em>exact</em> solution to the hiring manager's problem.

              <li>
                <strong>Analyze (The Hiring Manager's Lens): </strong> 
                First, we scrape and dissect the job description. We don't just look for words; we look for intent. What are the non-negotiables? What is the specific terminology? (e.g., Are they asking for "React.js" or "Frontend Engineering"?).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Match (The Alignment): </strong> 
                This is where the magic happens. We map your actual experience to their requirements. If you were a "Team Member" but they are looking for a "Collaborative Team Player," we align your language. We aren't inventing skills; we are ensuring your existing skills are recognized.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Optimize (The Narrative): </strong> 
                A list of keywords is robotic. We use advanced LLMs to rewrite your bullet points, emphasizing the achievements that matter <em>for this specific role</em> and removing the fluff that distracts from your value. We aim to preserve your authentic voice while making it sing the company's tune.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Preserve (The Delivery): </strong> 
                Finally, we solve the technical hurdle. We generate a PDF that follows the strict formatting standards of Harvard and MIT. No fancy columns, no confusing graphics—just clean, hierarchy-driven text that sails through the ATS to land on a human's desk.

              The Resume Monster has evolved from a set of scripts on my laptop to an <strong>Open Beta</strong> available to everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
               It remains a passion project at its heart. I am personally covering the server and LLM costs because I remember the pain of that "black hole." I want to help other qualified candidates avoid the silence of automated rejection.
            </p>
            <p>
               There is currently a waiting list to keep costs sustainable, but I am inviting new users as fast as I can.

            <h3 class="">A Note on the "Easy Apply Bot"</h3>
            <p>
               For those who found me through my open-source "LinkedIn Easy Apply Bot": <strong>I no longer recommend using it.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
               While it was a technical success, it is a strategic dead end. Automation without optimization just generates more noise. The goal isn't to apply to more jobs; it's to actually get interviewed. Use the optimizer instead—it's safer, more effective, and won't get you banned from LinkedIn.
