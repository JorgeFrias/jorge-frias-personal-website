            <p>
              The eyewear industry has remained largely unchanged for the past
              100 years. When shopping for eyeglasses or sunglasses, consumers
              still typically visit a brick-and-mortar store, try on a number of
              frames, and then purchase. If a prescription is needed, customers
              may have to wait a week or more for their glasses.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2019, brick-and-mortar stores still accounted for over 79% of
              eyewear sales. Interestingly, there are more brick-and-mortar
              eyewear stores than ever before. This is in stark contrast to
              other retail markets which have seen a decrease in the number of
              stores.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some companies, such as Warby Parker, have tried to disrupt the
              traditional eyewear shopping model, but ultimately have become a
              brick-and-mortar retail business.
            </p>
            <p>
              Traditional brick-and-mortar eyewear stores remain dominant
              despite potential for disruption, and more competitive and diverse
              offerings from independent online-exclusive eyewear brands.

            <p>
              The proliferation of brick-and-mortar stores and the slow rise of
              online alternatives can be attributed also to the monopoly of
              Essilor-Luxottica.

            <h2 class="">My role</h2>
            <p>
              When I co-founded Reliby in 2019, my goal was to create a
              multidisciplinary team of passionate and creative minds, eager to
              make a real difference in the world of eyewear retail. Our mission
              was clear: to help people buy eyewear online. We had no clear idea
              of how to do it, but we saw the opportunity, and we were ready for
              the challenges that lay ahead of us.
            </p>
            <p>
              I took on various roles, as is common for an underfunded startup
              founder, from developer to Product Manager, but Lead Product
              Designer is the one I enjoyed the most.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              We all worked as Product Designers. Each member of the team was
              their own army, doing tremendous work and coming up with unique
              ideas in many different domains. Product Design was no exception.
              I focused on crafting the user experience, the visual appearance,
              and ultimately the overall experience; however, we all shared our
              understanding, ideas, and feedback, which later became the
              incredible products we developed.
            </p>
            <p>
              This case study will illustrate how we moved from research to
              implementation, and what we learnt along the way.

            <h3>The Early Beginnings: Learning from Experience (V0)</h3>
            <p>
              Carlos and I (the co-founders) had been discussing for years the
              idea that a physical experience when buying sunglasses was often
              more rewarding than one online.
            </p>
            <p>
              After many informal conversations, we were finally able to come up
              with a concrete plan to make it happen: allowing people to use
              augmented reality to try on glasses. This became the foundation
              for Reliby.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although we were initially off about the specifics with the beta,
              we were able to gain a better understanding of the problem by
              forming a team and working on it exclusively. This allowed us to
              make the necessary adjustments and move forward.

            <h3>Solving the Problem Head-on (V1-V3)</h3>
            <p>
              Having built the initial version of the Virtual Try-On, we quickly
              discovered that users felt uncomfortable with it. The mirror was
              not “realistic enough”. So, we set out to make the experience more
              lifelike. We added reflections, photorealistic lenses, and
              simulated the lighting to match the user’s environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite our efforts, the mirror still wasn’t “realistic enough”,
              even though a third of users instinctively tried to adjust the
              glasses on their face during the virtual try-on, only to realize
              the glasses weren’t actually there. Although the virtual mirror
              was quite realistic, people still felt uncomfortable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nevertheless, this was enough to motivate us to continue working
              on the problem.

            <h3>What a realistic experience is (V4)</h3>
            <p>
              We soon realized that we weren’t fully understanding what
              “realistic” meant, but it took us a lot of effort to comprehend
              and create a way to convey the information through a screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              For months, all the team collaborated to identify issues with
              online shopping and how physical stores solve them. To gain
              insight, we visited stores to purchase glasses, interacted with
              customers, and had coffee with the store staff. We wanted to
              figure out how to surpass the brick-and-mortar experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              We spoke with independent retail store owners to learn about their
              work, challenges, problems, and costs. We didn’t even know how
              glasses were manufactured when we began, nor how prescriptions
              were made and glasses were assembled. We consulted with
              independent eyewear brands that sell exclusively online to learn
              about their struggles.We conversed with anyone who knew anything
              about glasses or had bought glasses online and wanted to talk with
              us.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this way, we were able to develop a user map of what people
              think when buying glasses in stores and online. We discovered a
              multitude of micro-experiences that trying eyewear in person
              provides, but the majority of people aren’t aware of and miss if
              they’re not available.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, we solved the second level:
              <strong>“Extended Augmented Reality”.</strong>

              <p>
                Shopping for eyewear is traditionally a real-life experience, so

                glasses as well as having them on hand.

              <p>
                Medical safety is also an important factor for customers to

                Customers are used to buying glasses that they like in the

                Online eyewear shopping should be a fun and enjoyable

                customers feeling uncomfortable, with glasses behind locked
                displays and unhelpful staff. New stores are attempting to give
                shoppers more freedom when choosing their glasses, but still
                lack certain liberties, such as the ability to take silly photos
                with wacky frames.

                <strong>Temple pressure: </strong>users must be informed about
                the pressure exerted by the glasses’ arms on their heads (loose,

                <strong>Bridge width warning: </strong>users must be warned if

            <p>
              The app must also be advantageous for the brands providing the
              products. It should create a hub that brings together independent
              eyewear brands that are not available in physical stores, giving
              them the first opportunity to sell their products competitively
              and allowing customers to try them on as if they were in a store.
              The brands come with certain requirements to the app:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Their products cannot not be mixed with other brands’ products.
              </li>
              <li>
                Their customers should be able to try on the glasses directly on
                their website.
              </li>
              <li>
                Their customers should be incentivized to purchase their brand
                if they installed the app.

              within the store. We wanted users to feel as familiar and
              comfortable as possible; thus, looking at the glasses on display
              should be one screen, picking them up to see them in detail should
              be another, trying them on should be yet another…

                Using the manufacturer photography wasn’t an option, as not only
                was the design not consistent across different brands, but the
                quality of the photographs also varied greatly.
              </p>
              <p>
                We found that even with great products and resources, some
                brands were unable to provide appealing images. There were also
                issues with reliability on color reproduction, particularly with
                the lenses.
              </p>
              <p>
                For these reasons, I decided to create our own imagery, ensuring
