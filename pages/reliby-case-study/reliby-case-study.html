            <p>
              The eyewear industry has remained largely unchanged for the past
              100 years. When shopping for eyeglasses or sunglasses, consumers
              still typically visit a brick-and-mortar store, try on a number of
              frames, and then purchase. If a prescription is needed, customers
              may have to wait a week or more for their glasses.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2019, brick-and-mortar stores still accounted for over 79% of
              eyewear sales. Interestingly, there are more brick-and-mortar
              eyewear stores than ever before. This is in stark contrast to
              other retail markets which have seen a decrease in the number of
              stores.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some companies, such as Warby Parker, have tried to disrupt the
              traditional eyewear shopping model, but ultimately have become a
              brick-and-mortar retail business.
            </p>
            <p>
              Traditional brick-and-mortar eyewear stores remain dominant
              despite potential for disruption, and more competitive and diverse
              offerings from independent online-exclusive eyewear brands.

            <h3 class="">A market deep-dive</h3>
            <p>
              The proliferation of brick-and-mortar stores and the slow rise of
              online alternatives can be attributed also to the monopoly of
              Essilor-Luxottica.
